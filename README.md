# Hexachess

Hexachess is an implementation of Gli≈Ñski's hexagonal chess in ASP.NET Core that I built during my second semester. The app features a real-time online-multiplayer mode that uses WebSockets (SignalR) but can also be played turn based on one screen.

## Setup

You can try out the app using Docker by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aarongoes/hexachess.git
cd ./hexachess
docker-compose up
```

and then navigating to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in your browser.
